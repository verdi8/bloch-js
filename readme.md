# Introduction
The BlochJS library is a Javascript library based on d3.js to draw and manipulate a Bloch Sphere representation of a qubit.
It uses the d3 library, especially the d3-geo functions for spherical shapes rendering. 

## What is a _Bloch Sphere_
## Demo


# How to use it

## Operations
```
rotateSphereTo(phi, lambda, gamma)
```
Rotates the whole sphere according to around the given three radians angles. 
Those angles are respectively around the d3/d3-geo
